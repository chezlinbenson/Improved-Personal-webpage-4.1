          Creativity is the foundation of this world. All things are shaped through the practice and disciplines of many brilliant minds over centuries. The great Leonardo Da Vinci was seen as a world influencer, followed by his amazing inventions,sculptures and paintings. Leonardo was a multidisciplinary artist. His name has made a great mark alongside other greats.<br><br>
          Design has evolved into a more innovative and problem solving field. Foundings of great inventors discovered design methodologies and interventions. Design thinking has has influenced many practices. The idea that design is not to create beautiful pictures etc., but it serves as innovative problem solving practices.<br><br>
          Today the world has moved towards a digital frontier. Creatives need to skill themselves in the new digital age. The "Age of Technology" or the "Dawn of Technology", are the debates of those in the curious and concious. And for those who are not, they are the consumers. Producing difficult scenarios. Coding and web design has been a tool that solves the problems of people. It connects users and businesses, a platform for information and education.

      <h2 id="Journey">My Journey</h2>
      <p class="journey-paragraph">
        Our present life has been influenced by many modern creative practisioners. The creative industry seems to be in the forefront of economical, social and cultural growth.<br><br>
        My adventure in life has always been inspired by art and many creative disciplines. Starting with drawings in primary school and later developed a deeper passion for art and design. At this time I had no idea what I am doing and had little knowledge of the art and design world as well as art and design dictionary. High school was a overwhelmed, curious, fun and yet scary theatre play. A time of discovering and growth. I soon discovered my great passion for art and design and later on, other design disciplines. Practicing my artistic skills through drawings and paintings, street art and murals was an exciting world in my imagination, that whispered in my ear almost every day.<br><br>
        In 2008 I enrolled into the Graphic Design course at Cape Peninsula University of Technology in Bellville. Completed my course in 2018. Learning the disciplines of Design, has helped me appreciate all creative and innovation ambitions. It was a privilege to be the first person in my family to complete their studies. It has been difficult to get a job in the design industry, but this problem has never stopped my passion. Freelancing has given me opportunities to grow and practice in multiple projects. Creativity still wakes me up in the morning. Inspired by different trends, my interest for coding and UX, UI has taken a new course into finally applying to a Coding School named, Code Your Future. I guess, I have to start somewhere. Creativity has opened many doorways of fun adventures. Meeting other artists, designers, innovators and places. Design meets Tech!
